# MCBasic
A simple plugin for Minecraft

# About MCBasic

MCBasic is a simple plugin for Spigot servers, it's a lite plugin so it can run on any server.

MCBasic is currently in beta and in the early stages of coding so expect to find some bugs.

You can find commands and permissions at this link:
https://github.com/Marbanz/MCBasic/blob/main/COMMANDS.txt

# Requirements

MCBasic is designed to use modern permissions plugins.

We strongly recommend LuckPerms.

MCBasic currently supports CraftBukkit, Spigot, and Paper.

Other server implementations may work, but we don't recommend them as they may cause compatibility issues.

# Support

If you have some problems with the plugin or you want to report a bug join my discord server:

# Metrics collection

MCBasic collects anonymous server statistics through bStats.
